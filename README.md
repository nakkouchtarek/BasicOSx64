# BasicOS

This is my take on a 64 bit OS, written from scratch. <br/>
I added some basic functionalities such as a terminal that contains a shell that interprets a few commands, such as a calculator. <br/>
I did stop there, since my final goal was to get a 64bit OS running and to understand how an OS operates and at what levels <br/>
Download the OS.bin from release folder and run it using qemu for 64 bit :

```
qemu-system-x86_64 OS.bin
```
